# ELIS - Scientific Integrity System

**ELIS** is a **FOREVER FREE AND OPEN-SOURCE** system designed to analyze the integrity of scientific data.

Our goal is to democratize access to advanced forensic tools, empowering researchers and integrity officers with robust and transparent tools to ensure the integrity of scientific records.

Currently, the system is focused on **image forensics**, but future versions will extend to text and statistical data analysis.


---

## Getting Started

To get ELIS running on your machine, you will need [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

#### 1. Clone the repository and submodules
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:researchintegrity/elis-backend.git
cd elis-backend
git submodule update --init --remote # ensure latest submodule versions

```

#### 1.1 Fix .env
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set the HOST_WORKSPACE_PATH
# >> HOST_WORKSPACE_PATH=<path/to-current-dir>/elis-backend/system_modules/elis-frontend/workspace
```

#### 2. Build the tools
This step could take some while as it will download and compile multiple models from different servers
```bash
docker compose --profile tools build
```

#### 3. Launch the backend
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### (Production Alternative) 3. Launch the backend with multiple workers (n=5)
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml up -d --scale workers=5 
```

#### 4. Launch the frontend
```bash
cd system_modules/elis-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

After instalation, visit **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)** to see the system in action!

## Implemented Modules

ELIS integrates multiple specialized modules to detect manipulation.

| Module | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[PDF Image Extraction](https://github.com/researchintegrity/pdf-image-extraction)** | Extracts images from scientific PDF documents for analysis. | <div align="center">✅</div> |
| **[Panel Extractor](https://github.com/researchintegrity/panel-extractor)** | Uses YOLO models to parse multi-panel figures into individual images. | <div align="center">✅</div> |
| **[Watermark Removal](https://github.com/researchintegrity/watermark-removal)** | Removes "RETRACTED" watermarks from PDF academic articles. | <div align="center">✅</div> |
| **[CBIR Search](https://github.com/researchintegrity/cbir-system)** | Finds similar images across datasets. | <div align="center">✅</div> |
| **[TruFor](https://github.com/researchintegrity/TruFor)** | Detects cheapfakes and image manipulations. | <div align="center">✅</div> |
| **[Copy-Move Detection](https://github.com/researchintegrity/copy-move-detection)** | Identifies duplicated regions within and across images.| <div align="center">✅</div> |
| **[Provenance Analysis](https://github.com/researchintegrity/provenance-analysis)** | Tracks reused and manipulated data across articles and datasets. | <div align="center">✅</div> |
